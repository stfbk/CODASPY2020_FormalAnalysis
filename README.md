# CODASPY2020_FormalAnalysis
This repository contains the complementary files referred to in the paper "**The Good, the Bad and the (Not So) Ugly of Out-Of-Band Authentication with eID Cards and Push Notifications: Design, Formal and Risk Analysis**", accepted to the *10th ACM Conference on Data and Application Security and Privacy* (CODASPY â€˜20).

In our paper, we present a novel passwordless, multi-factor authentication protocol based on eID cards. To assess the security of this protocol, we have formally modelled it through the specification language **ASLan++**, a high-level language that formalizes the interactions between the different protocol roles. These models have then been given in input to **SATMC** (SAT-based Model Checker), an open and flexible platform for model-checking security protocols via reduction to SAT.

Thereby, this repository contains ASLan++ file and analyses outputs.
